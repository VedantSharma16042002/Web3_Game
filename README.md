###Web3_Game

Web3_Card Game is a decentralized card game where cards are made of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The game is designed to be played by two players who compete to win by using their NFT cards to attack and defend against their opponent's cards.

#How to Play
To start playing Web3_Card Game, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet with some Ethereum (ETH) and some NFT cards. You can acquire NFT cards by buying them from a marketplace or by creating them yourself using a platform like OpenSea.

Once you have your NFT cards, you can start a new game by choosing your opponent and selecting the NFT cards that you want to use. The game will then begin, and each player will take turns attacking and defending using their NFT cards. The game ends when one player has no more cards to use, and the other player wins.

#How it Works
Web3_Card Game is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which means that all game data is stored on the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone. The game uses smart contracts to manage the game rules, which are enforced by the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each NFT card in the game is a unique asset that is stored on the blockchain and can be traded or sold just like any other NFT. The game uses the NFT cards to represent the players' armies, and each card has its own unique set of attributes, such as attack power, defense power, and special abilities.

When a player attacks with an NFT card, the game uses a random number generator to determine the outcome of the attack, based on the attacker's attack power and the defender's defense power. The winner of the attack deals damage to the loser's card, and the game continues until one player has no more cards to use.
